    * I like how your hangman draws out the hangman parts as it would normally be done on paper.  Good job making this work properly. <br>
    * I like the use of this code below (interpolation) <br>
       // In the case the user is wrong then a guess is added to the total and the image is changed on the screen
       // else{
       //     hangImg.src=`./media/${guesses+2}.png`;
       //     guesses += 1;
       // }
